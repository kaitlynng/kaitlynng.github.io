              <h2>Predict Marriages and Birth Rates with Economic Data (the Long Way)</h2>
              <p>
                This project aims to predict Singapore's number of marriages and crude birth rate using economic data.
                This guide provides a step-by-step approach to every mistake I have made, so take this tutorial with a
                pinch of salt.

              <h3>Step 1: Choosing features</h3>
              <p>The first step to a good machine learning model is always to choose the right features for your predictions.
                My original intentions had been to select a mix of both social and economic indicators and compare their
                relative accuracy in predicting birth rates/marriages, and also to combine some of these factors to obtain
                socio-economic indicators.
                <br><br>
                For Singapore data, a few of the sites that I consulted are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://data.gov.sg/">Data.gov</a>: ended up being my only source of data</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data">Singstat</a>: datasets tended to be too small</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall.html"> LTA Data Mall</a>: I was impressed by the amount of data, but not relevant</li>
                <li>Many other <a href="https://www.smartnation.sg/resources/open-data-resources">open source data</a> on Singapore that was sadly irrelevant</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A big drawback for me was that I could not find any datasets on social indicators that went far enough back
                (at least 1995) for me to have a sizeable dataset. While kind of comprehensive, the data on data.gov was also lacking in
                data with causal relationships, making it difficult to explore predictive models using the available data.
                <br><br>
                In the end, I settled with what I had (for now):
                <br><br>
                <b>X data:</b>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Year (I was expecting this to be a problem due to correlation issues)</li>
                <li>Consumer Price Index, Monthly</li>
                <li>Gross Domestic Product at Current Market Prices, Annually</li>
                <li>Job Vacancy Rate, Quarterly</li>
                <li>Resident Unemployment Rate, Quarterly</li>
                <li>Average Weekly Paid Overtime Hours per Employee, Quarterly</li>
              </ol>
              <p><b>Y data</b></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Crude Birth Rates, Annually</li>
                <li>Marriages under the Womens' Charter, Annually</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                All the data was obtained from data.gov in csv file format.

              <h3>Step 2: Cleaning the Data</h3>
              <p>
                Cleaning the data proved to be more problematic than I thought it would be. Since the predicted values are annual data, I
                decided to process the quarterly and monthly data to return annual figures of [mean, standard deviation, direction, correlation].
                "Direction" and "Correlation" will be elaborated on more later.
                <br><br>
                I used the pandas dataframe for data processing. It was a pain to pick up, but ultimately useful as it is an organised
                way to handle data that can be extended to large datasets, and has many built-in functions that make data processing
                not that difficult (e.g. iterrows, df.loc, df.apply). Pandas dataframes are also a well-supported type in python, and is handled
                with no problem by scikit-learn.
                <br><br>
                The processing steps were:
                <br><br>
                1. Split up the monthly and quarterly date data
                <br>Date data was split from "YYYY-month" or "YYYY-quarter" into "YYYY", then subsequent columns for each sub-division. This makes processing
                later on much easier as data from each subdivision are later handled as features of that year.
                <br><br>
                2. Handle empty values
                <br>Empty values are usually handled later on with the rest of the feature processing steps, but I had to handle them now as I was
                planning to use linear regression to obtain more features from sub-divided years, and linear regression cannot handle null values. Null values
                were simply replaced with the mean of the other values in the column.
                <br><br>
                3. Perform linear regression
                <br>Let linear regression be y = Ax+b. In this case, the y values are the quarterly or monthly data in each year, the x value is the sub-division
                of the y data in the year (ranging from 0 to 1). A linear regression is performed on each year and the "Direction" feature refers to the variable
                A in (y=Ax+b), while the feature "correlation" refers to the coefficient of determination, giving the strength of the linear relationship between
                x and y. The linear regression was performed using sklearn LinearRegression method.
                <br><br>
                After going in to do some simple data procesing myself (deleting columns etc.), the data is now ready for further processing.

            <div class="post-part">
              <h3>Step 3: Data Exploration</h3>
              <p>
                Now that the data has been prettified, it is time for some visualisation to gain insights on the data on hand. From here on, I will foxus on crude
                birth rates as the predicted y value.
                <br><br>
                First, I combined all the features into one large features dataframe. I was initially considering adding polynomial features and performing PCA
                to narrow down the feature space, but after performing train-test split, my number of data points and number of features became comaparable and I did not
                want to risk having too many features.
                <br><br>
                Next, I looked at the correlations between the y data and each of the features. By using the pandas .coor() function, I obtained a list of
                correlations.

              <p>
                Here you can see that "year" is most highly correlated with the birth rate, which may present as a problem by creating a model that suggests that Singapore's
                falling birth rate is inevitable. "Overtime_mean" is also highly correlated with crude birth rate, however there is the problem of correlation vs. causation,
                and the causal effect between these two variables is unclear.
                <br><br>
                To gain greater insights, I picked 6 of the features most linearly correlated with crude birth rates and plotted them all against each other in a scatter plot:
              </p>
              <img src="img/crude-birth-rate_corr_scatter.png" alt="crude-birth-rate scatter plot">
              <p>
                From the scatter plot we can see that the relationship between "year" and birth rate more closely follows an exponential function, as well as with other factors
                "gdp_value" and "cpi_mean". Thus, I performed an exponential decay function on these three features to hopefully give a better linear correlation between the
                  features and the y value.

              <p>
                After fitting the exponential function, the improvement looks marginal in the scatter plot, but the correlation values showed a small improvement and I decided to
                just take what I have and move on to the transformation pipeline.
